EVENT LISTENERS

<!--Basic layout of a listener-->

if (click) { doSomething(); }
else {
// carry on with rest of the program }

document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);


<!--This code will attach an event listener to the docoment's body:-->

document.body.addEventListener('click', doSomething);

addEventListener('click', () => alert('You Clicked!));

<!--Alternatively, a named function could be declared and then referenced in the event listener:-->

function doSomething() {
alert('You Clicked!);
}

addEventListener('click', doSomething);

You can see different events ranging from when a video has finished playing to when a resource has completed downloading.

MOUSE EVENTS
You can change color of things when mouse moves over them.

KEYBOARD EVENTS
(keydown, keypress and keyup)
Shift, control, alt and meta will fire the keydown and keyup events, but no the keypress event.

TOUCH EVENTS

Smart phones and touchscreens.
touchstart event happens when user touches the surface.
touchmove- when user touches screen and moves around without leaving.

touchenter- user already started touching surface, then passes over the element to which the event listener is attached.

touchleave - still touching surface, but leaves element to which event listener is attached.

touchcancel - when touch event is interrupted.
